This is a private script for criminality.
How does auto farm work?
⚠️We need at least two accounts that have access to the "Standard" mode, lvl 15+ or gamepass "Prime".
We enter the standard from two accounts, we teleport 1 account on which we will farm money to a any place. 
On this account we turn on the melee aura , on the second account in TP target we enter the nickname 1 account
Now just turn it on teleport farm and earn money and lvl. 
⚠️INITIALLY THIS SCRIPT WAS PAID BUT I AM LEAKING IT FOR YOU FOR FREE
